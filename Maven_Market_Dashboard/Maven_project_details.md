📊 I am so excited to share the Maven Market Retail Dashboard I've crafted using Power BI! 🚀

This data set is provided by Maven Analytics as a bonus project for "Microsoft Power BI Dekstop for Business Intelligence (2023)" Course on Udemy. In this project we have the freedom to design and decide what to visualize in the dashboard. These are general key points from the dahsboard:

🏠 General Report :
1. Dive into the latest month's KPIs
2. Track monthly revenue by country and keep an eye on total revenue vs. target for the year
3. Explore performance by Product Brand
4. Show distribution of transactions by country
5. Provide a dynamic map showcasing transactions across cities.


🚀 This comprehensive dashboard provides a 360-degree view of Maven Market's retail performance, enabling data-driven decisions and strategic planning. 📈💡

For the next post I would explain each pages of the dashboard and also the process of making it. Stay Tuned 😊
